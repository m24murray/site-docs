# Raspberry Pi - Input & Output scripts
## Overview
I think the Raspberry Pi is an incredible piece of kit and is a great place to start when learning basic coding or electronics concepts. In this guide, I'll be talking through a few basic concepts for controlling I/O on the Raspberry Pi.

## Getting started
### Setting up the breadboard
- Connect a jumper cable from GND to the negative line
- Connect GPIO number 7 to elsewhere on the board
- Connect your LED (positive end beside the GPIO jumper)
- Resistor from LED negative end to negative line 
- Connect your breadboard to the Raspberry Pi
