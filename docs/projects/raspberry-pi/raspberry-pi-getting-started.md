# Raspberry Pi - Getting started
## Overview
There are a few things you need to get started with a Raspberry Pi:
- Raspberry Pi 
- SD card
- Electronics breadboard (with basic components such as LEDs, resistors, jumper leads e.t.c)

!!! note
    There are various different models of the Raspberry Pi and some may be more suitable depending on your usage. 
    For starting out, I generally favour models which include a full-sized HDMI port as well as at least 2 USB 2.0 ports.

## Getting started
There are countless number of guides and tools which will talk help get your Raspberry Pi up-and-running. In my opinion, I think using the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/) is a great place to start and will easily install the Raspberry Pi OS to your device.

## Troubleshooting
If you ever break your Raspberry Pi, just re-flash the image.
